# Morals

Moral foundations that form the basis for moral judgments and ethical judgments.

## Care/Harm

This foundation is associated with our ability to care for others and avoid causing harm. It is rooted in empathy and compassion. People who prioritize this foundation value kindness, nurturance, and protection of others.

## Fairness/Cheating

This foundation is related to the concepts of justice, equality, and reciprocity. Individuals who emphasize this foundation are concerned with fairness, cooperation, and avoiding unfair treatment or exploitation.

## Loyalty/Betrayal

Loyalty is the third moral foundation and is centered around group cohesion and allegiance. It involves a sense of duty and allegiance to one's group, tribe, family, or community. Betrayal is viewed negatively within this framework.

## Authority/Subversion

This foundation pertains to respect for authority and social order. Individuals who prioritize this foundation value hierarchy, tradition, and respect for authority figures. They may be more inclined to follow rules and maintain social order.

## Sanctity/Degradation

The sanctity foundation is associated with the sacred or pure aspects of life. It includes values related to avoiding impurity, pollution, or degradation. This foundation often plays a role in religious or cultural beliefs about what is holy or sacred.

## Liberty/Oppression

Liberty is the sixth and final moral foundation, emphasizing the value of autonomy, freedom, and protection against oppression. People who prioritize this foundation are concerned with individual rights, personal freedom, and resistance to tyranny.

## Discussion

These moral foundations are by Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist, whos proposed the idea of six moral foundations that form the basis for moral and ethical judgments across diverse cultures. 

These part of Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory, which suggests that moral reasoning is not solely based on harm and fairness but also encompasses a broader set of values. 

Haidt argues that these moral foundations are not universally distributed across individuals or cultures. Instead, they are shaped by a combination of evolutionary processes, cultural influences, and personal experiences. Different individuals and cultures may place varying degrees of importance on each foundation, leading to diverse moral perspectives.

Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory provides a framework for understanding the diversity of moral values and judgments, offering insights into how individuals and societies navigate ethical questions. It has been influential in the fields of psychology, sociology, and ethics, contributing to discussions about the nature of morality and the factors that shape our moral intuitions.
